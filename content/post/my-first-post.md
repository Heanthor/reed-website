## Introduction

I spend a lot of time thinking and building, but not sharing and engaging in conversation. But accomplishments feel more hollow if you can't share them widely. So, I'm resurrecting my website project once again, both as a project to get back into frontend development, and as a space to put thoughts, tech insights, music, photography, or anything else I happen to create.

I used to have a simple personal website built on Bootstrap 4 (or 3?), with some simple custom functionality. I think I built a shopping list on Django and used it in the grocery store one time? The plans for this iteration are bigger: I want to integrate as many of my various projects as possible, adding live demos, realtime information, or other fun toys to the site to document and bring more attention to the things I've built over the years.

I'm starting with a simple Hugo theme, hosted statically with no frills, but we will see how the site evolves over time.
